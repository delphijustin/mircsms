This is a plugin that lets you access IRC over texting. I wanted something for my phone that I would not having to open a app everytime my phone starts.

System Requirements
* For compiling you will need Delphi 4.0 with TmIRCControl
* A Textbelt API Key(you will have to buy credits)
* mIRC Chat client (This app is shareware and only have to pay it once)

To use open smsbot.bat it will start mIRC if its not running
